            <h2>Caring for Your Dog</h2>
            <p>Follow these steps to ensure your dog's well-being:</p>
            <div class="step" style="text-align: center" >
                <h3>1. Regular Exercise</h3>
                <p>Take your dog for daily walks or engage in other physical activities.</p><br>
				<p>Dog owners enjoy numerous health and social benefits by walking their dog a few times a week. Benefits include improved cardiovascular fitness, lower blood pressure, stronger muscles and bones (built up by walking regularly), and decreased stress. A regular walk is vitally important for your pet's health too.</p>
                <img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures\dog\dog.jpg"><br><br>
				<h3 >1.1 Second Exercise:</h3>
				<p style="text-align:justify">Sufficient exercise is a key part in keeping your dog healthy, happy, and away from destructive habits such as chewing. In general, dogs need at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise each day. Along with that 30 minutes, your dog should also get at least 15 minutes of interactive play each day as well.</p><br>
            <img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures\dog\article-exercising-your-dog.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class="step" style="text-align: center">
			<h3> 1.2 Third Exercise:</h3>
			<p>Your German Shepherd will need a minimum of two hours of exercise every day.</p><br>
			<p >What types of exercise are best for German Shepherds:<br>
Agility.<br>
Flyball.<br>
Canicross.<br>
Tracking.<br>
Disc dog.<br>
Bikejoring.<br>
Obedience training.<br>
Swimming.<brf>
</p>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"> Agility:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Agility. German Shepherds have a unique flowing gait. Their movement should be, according to the breed standard, “outreaching, elastic, seemingly without effort, smooth and rhythmic.” Add in their strength, precision, and desire to follow instructions and you have a winning combination for agility.</p>
	<img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures\dog\gsd_agility.jpg"><br>
	<p style="text-align: justify">The West-German Working Line is widely considered the most popular type of German Shepherd. They're a medium-sized dog, and they have short hair that's easy to maintain. This breed makes for excellent pets because they tend to stay calm around new people and animals.</p>
	<img src=" C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures\dog\3464760464_8542e4ca09_b.jpg">
<h3 style="text-align: justify"> Flyball:</h3>	
<p style="text-align: justify">All dogs 15 months of age or older can compete in the sport of flyball. The sport is open to all breeds from Yorkshire Terriers to Great Danes to mixed breeds.<br>
With the chance to chase, jump, catch, retrieve and run, it gives dogs the chance to do all of the things they love. Although any dog can enjoy flyball, if you are looking to seriously compete then it is important to work with a dog who has plenty of energy and is good at following commands.</p>
<img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures\dog\Solo_Run_1697190796.jpg"width=600px,height=300px><br>
<h3 style="text-align: justify"> Tracking:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">The military and police have used the German Shepherd for centuries because of their bravery and tracking abilities. They are able to find missing victims and even soldiers who have been hurt or killed in war without even worrying about their own safety. They're also extremely smart and loyal.</p>
 <p>Since all dogs have a natural ability to follow a scent, any breed is capable of learning to track.</p>           
			<img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures\dog\tracking-dog.jpg"><br>
			
	<h3 style="text-align: justify"> Disc dog:</h3>	
<p style="text-align: justify">Disc dog (commonly called Frisbee dog) is a dog sport. In disc dog competitions, dogs and their human flying disc throwers compete in events such as distance catching and somewhat choreographed freestyle catching. The sport celebrates the bond between handler and dog, by allowing them to work together.</p>	
	<p>The top dogs in canine disc are border collies, australian shepherds, mcnabs, and cattle dogs. Davy Whippet holds the most World Records in Frisbee.</p>

		<h3 style="text-align: justify"> Swimming:</h3>	
		<p style="text-align: justify">While some dogs are natural swimmers and enjoy being in the water, not all dogs have the same inclination. It depends on their breed, individual preferences, and past experiences. Some dogs may require more time and training to become comfortable in the water.</p>
		<p style="text-align: left">In most cases, certain breeds of dogs love water because they were originally bred to be used for water activities, like retrieving waterfowl during hunting. “Dogs that have historically been bred to work in and around water usually love to swim,” Dr. Coates told The Dodo.</p>

		<p style="text-align: justify">How to teach your dog how to swim?<br>
<p style="center">Lead your dog gently into the water. ...</p><br>
<p style="center">Once they seem at ease, lead them deeper into the water. ...</p><br>
<p style="center">Your dog's first instinct will be to paddle with only their front legs. ...</p><br>
<p style="center">Make sure your dog is all the way in the water and that you are holding them around the belly.</p><br>

                <h2 style="text-align: center">2. Proper Nutrition</h2>
                <p>Provide a balanced diet suitable for your dog's age, size, and breed.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify">What are the nutritional requirements for dogs? <br>
				<p>The six basic nutrients are water, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins. These essential nutrients are required as part of the dog's regular diet and are involved in all of the basic functions of the body.</p>
                
			<img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures\dog\Why-you-must-provide-a-balanced-and-nutritious-diet-2.jpg" alt="Dog food" width="800px" style=" border-radius: 38px; margin-left: 300px"><br>
            <p style="text-align: justify">The best food to feed is a high quality commercial kibble designed for puppies. This ensures all the nutrients your puppy needs for growth and development are present. You can add cooked meats and vegetables or rice as you wish; however, the main diet needs to be the commercially balanced kibble.<br>
			No! If given long term, pedigree can make dogs more prone to liver or kidney problems. The first ingredient in this dog food is corn, corn is generally a filler. The second ingredient is poultry by-product meal, which is dried product from a slaughterhouse.
			</p>
			<p style="text-align: center">Recommended daily feeding guide for dogs:<br>
Dog weight (up to 10 kg): 100-160 g.<br> Dog weight (10-25 kg): 150-300 g. <br>Dog weight (25-50 kg): 320-470 g. Dog weight (50-100 kg): 530-950 g.</p>

            <div class="step">
                <h3>1. Basic Commands</h3>
                <p>Teach your dog basic commands like sit, stay, and come.</p>
				<p style="text-align: center"><h2 style="text-align:center">Tricks to teach your dog:</h2><br>
<p style="text-align: justify">1.Come. One of the most essential commands you can teach your dog is "come." This command is important for recall, and can help keep your dog safe in a variety of situations.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Sit.<br>
Stay.<br>
Potty. <br>
Ring the bell.<br> 
Play. <br>

                <h3>2. Socialization</h3>
                <p>Expose your dog to various social situations and environments.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify">Bringing a new dog into the house can be a very exciting time. There is a lot to learn and a lot to teach to help your new best friend become a member of the family. Aside from teaching your dog basic commands, getting your puppy on a feeding schedule and house training, it is important to socialize your puppy. When a dog is well-socialized, they will be more at ease with new people, new dogs and new situations.
Here are four tips you’ll want to keep in mind during the process of socializing your new best friend.</p>
                <img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures\dog\socializing-dogs.webp" alt="Dog socialization" style="margin-left: 240px" ><br>
				
			
			<h3 style="text-align:center">SOCIALIZATION AND YOUR ADULT DOG:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Socializing an adolescent and adult dog is all about creating routines. Dogs do best when they have a routine to work from, as it provides them with a means to understand their day-to-day life. 
What does this involve? It’s a mixture of keeping them puppy-like and playful and giving them a routine they can understand, as well as regularly rewarding them for good behavior, like handing them bully sticks to gnaw on. 	</p><br>
  <img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures\dog\Socializing-Adult-Dogs.webp"style=" border-radius: 38px; margin-left: 400px">
  <h3 style="text-align:center">WATCHING THEIR PLAYTIME:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">One of the best things you can do is just introduce your dogs to other people and dogs, watching their behavior the entire time the interaction takes place. You’ll want to make sure they’re comfortable and aren’t showing signs of aggression. However, if they are showing aggression, don’t worry. That and barking are natural signs of discomfort in dogs. It doesn’t mean they want to cause harm— they just are unsure about what’s happening and want to keep themselves safe. 

If you’re worried about those around you, remove your dog from the situation until they calm down and then try again. It requires patience, but it’s a worthwhile way to teach your dog. </p>

<h3 style="text-align:center">CREATING SOCIAL TIME:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">Along with watching them while they play, you also need to create social time for your dog. This could be setting up a doggy playdate with a friend’s or neighbor’s dog or bringing your dog to the dog park. This time is for you and your dog to hang out with some other people. It’s also a great time to let your dog socialize and watch their behavior as they play. If they ever seem stressed or are getting a little snippy with other dogs, calmly call their name and take some time away from the pack to calm down.</p> 

<h3 style="text-align:center">SENIOR DOGS STILL LIKE TO HAVE FUN:</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">They may say an old dog can’t learn new tricks, but they can. It just takes time and patience. So don’t feel overwhelmed if your dog ever seems uneasy or annoyed while trying to get them to meet new people and dogs. With some consideration, your senior dog can gradually get used to having fun with new people and dogs.

        <div class="section">
            <h1>Health and Nutrition</h1>
            <p>Ensure your dog's health with proper nutrition:</p>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>1. Regular Vet Check-ups</h3>
                <p>Take your dog to the vet for routine check-ups and vaccinations.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify">Once they are older than 1 year, you can take them once every 4 to 6 months, unless they have a particular disorder or condition that requires more frequent monitoring. Adult dogs and cats require at least one veterinary check-up every 4 to 6 months. Don't wait until your pet is sick to take them to the vet.</p>
				<p style="text-align:justify">Regular wellness check-ups allow your veterinarian to detect small signs, like changes in breathing, heart rate, eyes, and even minor swellings. <p>
                <img src="C:\Users\Administrator\Pictures\dog\how-often-should-my-pet-visit-the-vet.jpg" alt="Dog at the vet" style=" border-radius: 38px; margin-left: 300px">
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>2. Healthy Diet</h3>
                <p>Provide a diet rich in essential nutrients and avoid overfeeding.</p>
				<p style="text-align: justify">Fresh fruit and raw vegetables are a healthy treat option for dogs; there aren’t any added chemicals, artificial flavors or coloring and your pet benefits from the extra vitamins and minerals.

However, just like kids, dogs can be picky eaters. You may discover that while one particular fruit or vegetable suits your pet’s palate, another may have him disdainfully turning his nose away.

<p style="text-align: justify">Don’t bombard your dog with an assortment of fresh goodies when first introducing a new food group; start by treating your dog to one particular fruit or vegetable at a time for a few days. By doing so, you can pinpoint whether or not the treat du jour is causing an upset stomach or diarrhea.

It’s important not to feed your dog toxic fruit or vegetables, warns Dr. Tony Buffington, a diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Nutrition.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Buffington has a PhD in animal nutrition, was a resident clinical nutritionist at the Veterinary Medicine Teaching Hospital at UC Davis, and has been a professor of veterinary clinical sciences at Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine since 1987.

“With regard to alternative treats, we recommend small amounts of fruits and veggies all the time,” advises Buffington.</p>

Before stocking your fridge, take note of which fruits and vegetables are safe to feed your dog.</p>
<h3 style="text-align:center"> Safe Fruits to Feed Dogs</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify"> With the exception of citric fruits, which may upset your dog’s stomach, most fruits are safe to feed to your pet.

Importantly, never feed your pet a whole fruit with a pit or seeds intact. The pit is a choking hazard, and seeds can lead to gastric issues and be a choking hazard as well. Clean the fruit, then slice it in pieces and give to your pet as a treat.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"> 
Apples<br>
Apricots<br>
Bananas<br>
Blueberries<br>
Mangos<br>
Pears<br>
Pineapples<br>
Raspberries<br>
Strawberries  <br></p>

			 <h3 style="text-align:center">Smart Choices for a Healthy Pet</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify">It’s important that you be aware of your dog’s unique dietary needs in order to ensure his lifelong health. Make smart choices about feeding treats to your pets, recommends Buffington.

“From a nutritional point of view, we don’t recommend feeding so much that the treats make any significant contribution to the pet’s nutrient intake, or dilute or imbalance their regular diet.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">“We also remind owners that there are plenty of non-food treats from their pet’s point of view; play treats, walk treats, ‘teach me a trick’ treats, grooming treats,” says Buffington “All of these contribute to a positive human-animal relationship without adding calories.”

If you are unsure of which alternate treat to feed your pet, discuss your concerns with your family veterinarian before introducing a new type of food to your dog.</p>
